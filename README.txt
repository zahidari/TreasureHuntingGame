This is a Treasure Hunting Game written in JAVA.

The purpose of this project was to replicate a game and gain an
understanding of how Object-oriented programming functions.

range. Additionally, I attempted to organize methods by either dividing 
them or consolidating them into a single class, while leveraging object
interactions for practical implementation.
